# Robot Programming

This repository contains a ROS-based simulated grape-counting robot system that traverses each side of a grape vine to count bunches of grapes.

The robot is based on a real physical robot design in active use at the University of Lincoln, equipped with a range of sensors and four independently steerable wheels.  The simulated robot accurately reflects many of the real world elements, such as obstacle detection using lidar, kinect camera views on three sides (not back) and the environment in this example contains a fairly accurate representation of a planeted vine - with other more complex environments available to test the robot's abilities.

To successfully run the system and see it working, ideally clone the full robprog repository as this contains not only the scripts but also dependencies such as worlds, rviz visualiser, maps and software tools that were used to reach the end stage of development.

Here's a new line







Need to start the ROS environment using Docker...

Navigate to the robprog directory (on the Mac interface) type: docker-compose up

REMEMBER: at the end of the session, CTRL-C thentype docker-control down to ensure it is not still running in the background.


Type http://localhost:6080/ in a web-browser

Use http://localhost:6081/ for the code editor

Launch LXTERMINAL from the virtual environment.

Type roslaunch bacchus_gazebo vineyard_demo.launch

More complex environment with different plant stages:

roslaunch bacchus_gazebo vineyard_demo.launch world_name:=<WORLD>
with <WORLD> being one of the following:

vineyard_small
  
vineyard_small_s0_coarse
  
vineyard_small_s1_coarse
vineyard_small_s2_coarse
vineyard_small_s3_coarse
vineyard_small_s4_coarse
vineyard_stage0
vineyard_stage0_heightmap
vineyard_stage0_small
vineyard_stage1
vineyard_stage2
vineyard_stage3
vineyard_stage4
vineyard_stage4_small

# Setting up a catkin package
  
Navigate to your folder that will contain your package...
(in my case this is called cmp9767_ws (for workspace)

Type:
$ source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
  
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
  
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/
  
$ catkin_make
  
Now use (in this example) http://localhost:6081/?folder=/home/ubuntu/cmp9767_ws to develop the packages in a way that they can be exported correctly.
 
Now - you need to overlay your workspace on top of the environment so navigate to 'devel' folder and type 
  "source setup.sh" and check that the $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH includes the directory you are in.
